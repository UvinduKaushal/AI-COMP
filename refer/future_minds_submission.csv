27,How did the Buddhist renaissance contribute to rising nationalism and patriotism in Sri Lanka?,"The Buddhist renaissance in Sri Lanka involved movements to upgrade patriotism and nationalism.  Anagarika Dharmapala's efforts to protect Buddhist religious places, such as Buddhagaya in India, fostered a sense of national and religious identity.  The renovation of sites like Ruwanweli Seya also contributed to this feeling of national pride and preservation of cultural heritage.  Furthermore, the establishment of Buddhist presses facilitated the publication of Sinhala-language newspapers and magazines (like Sinhala Jathiya and Sinhala Bauddhaya), which promoted nationalist and Buddhist sentiments.

Introduction
The word 'revolution' stands for a significant change that occurs in a particular field 
within a short period of time. Such a change occurred in the industrial sector is called as the industrial revolution. The change that occurred during the religious renaissance in Europe is called as the religious renaissance. There had been several such revolutions in the political field also. The struggle for freedom in America or the American revolution, the French revolution and the Russian revolution are examples for such revolutions.

He exclaimed that the king must work for the betterment of people; if otherwise, the people have the rights to chase away such rulers. His ideas became the foundation of equality and people's sovereignty. On the other hand, the French soldiers who went to 
support the American freedom struggle had identified concept of freedom there and started to activate it in France encouraging the French revolution. 
 The Revolution

financial problems in France where there had been continuous protests. A reform in taxes was necessary to settle that situation. The king had to summon the council called, States General Council. There were problems on   the agenda of the meeting because the bureau had not met for 175 years.

76,What role did Mussolini play in the lead-up to World War II?,"These battles are called world wars because a number of powerful countries took part in these wars and affected the whole world. World leaders stepped into different conventions in order to avoid further world wars because of the disaster caused in the first two world wars. This lesson focuses its attention on the factors that led to the world wars, their nature, results as well as the United Nation's Organization and its importance.
8.1  World War I
Map 8.1 How World War I spread all over the world
- 127 -The war that spread throughout the world between 1914 and 1918 is named as World War I. The history does not know any war that invaded every continent before this. This war began in Europe and later spread into their colonies also. Thereafter, when United States too joined the war, it became a world war that invaded all continents.
 Reasons for World War I
• France and Germany became enemies in the attempt of making a united 
Germany.

It was World War II.
- 135 - ACTIVITY
1. Mark the countries that joined in World War I on a map.2. Explain three reasons for  World War I.3. Mention two results of  World War I.
8.3. World War II 
We learned above that World War I ended by 1918 A.D. Another world war began to rise within two decades after  World War I. As a result, another world war occurred. This devastating battle that lasted for six years from September 1939 to August 1945 is called  World War II.  
 Reasons for World War IIThough World War II began in 1939, it did not break out so suddenly. The 
competition that existed between powerful countries and the behaviour of some European countries set the background for another war in about a decade after World War I. When this situation is considered, several reasons that kindled the war can be identified. Let's study those in detail.
